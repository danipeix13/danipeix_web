# Final Project Submission
This is the final post of `Monocular Depth Estimation using RBG signals` project.I will present all the work done and results of the project with link to all my contributions and issues that needs to resolved along with future extensions.<br/>

## Brief Description
Depth Estimation is one of the attractive research areas in computer vision. The motivation of this project is to estimate depth without the use of LIDAR sensors or any other related costly setups. And it also makes the robot more robust and efficient to carry out any task using the crucial depth information.<br/>

In this project, Myself, **Vaibhaw Khemka**, worked with RoboComp and my mentor, **Mohamed Shawky**,
