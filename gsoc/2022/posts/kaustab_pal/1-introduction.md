# GSoC'22 RoboComp project: Model Predictive Control for obstacle avoidance 

30th June 2022

## About me

I am a MS by research student associated with the Robotics Research Center in
International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad. My work is focused
on trajectory optimization for autonomous vehicles using Model Predictive
Controls.

## About the Project ...

Model Predictive Control is a form of Optimal Control that can be used to
compute robot navigation control actions in real-time, directly from the dynamic
model of the robot, constraints on its parameters and LIDAR data. The goal of
this project is to first evaluate the performance of the existing MPC and then
improve upon the shortcomings. The current implementation uses the free balls
algorithm to avoid obstacles. The project will focus on where this algorithm is
failing and how to improve upon that. I will also be looking at how to represent
obstacles in a better way so that the performance of the MPC algorithm is faster
and the solutions are better quality.
