## Where can I start and what to include on my application?

2.  Follow the tutorials: [https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/tree/stable/doc#tutorials](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/tree/stable/doc#tutorials).
3.  Once you are familiar with RoboComp and the components and tools involved in the particular idea you want to contribute to, try to understand how these components/tools work and, if possible, their design.
4.  Participate in gsoc [gitter](https://gitter.im/robocomp/robocomp/robocomp-gsoc) asking any question you might have.
5.  Create a schedule with the milestones you plan to follow during the GSoC 2022 program.
6.  **Send the schedule and any code you might have written along with your CV and other application materials to the mentor of your idea and the backup mentor ([/web/gsoc/2022/ideas/#complete-list-of-mentors](/web/gsoc/2022/ideas/#complete-list-of-mentors)).**
